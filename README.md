Fetch GRIB files from NOAA's NOMADS repository

NOAA NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) makes a repository of GRIB files from many weather models via NOMADS (NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System). This configurable program fetches recent forcasts from several models, building a consolidated standard GRIB file viewable with many apps.
